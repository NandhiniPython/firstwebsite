          <h3>Ice Cream</h3>
          <p class="skd3">Historians still aren’t sure who truly invented ice cream. What we do know is it’s been a sweet treat for a long time! The first record of ice cream in America is in a letter dated 1744. American presidents like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison all enjoyed ice cream.
Until the 1800s, ice cream was a rare treat. Ice houses helped make it possible for people to store ice cream at home. “The Father of Ice Cream, ” Augustus Jackson, an African American man, created and tested different ways to make ice cream in the 1830s. He later distributed his recipes to different Philadelphia business owners. In 1846, Nancy Johnson invented the hand crank ice cream churn. This allowed people
to make ice cream at home!</p>
